## Markdown formatting

This is regular text

**this is bold text** -use \** 

*this is italics* -use \*

***This is bold italics*** -use \***

If you use two spaces at the end of the line  
it makes a new line which is closer together than an enter

If you type each sentence in a new line git will track them separately.
However they will still appear the same in markdown.
Like this.

Making simple table is easy with vertical lines, but you need an empty line before the table

This is a header | And another header
--- | ---
this is next line | and another column
And another line | and a second column

## Doing superscipts and subscripts

Superscript looks like<sup>superscript</sup> - by adding \<sup> before and \</sup> after  
Subscript look like<sub>subscript</sub> - by adding \<sub> before and \</sub> after

## links

[this is the text i want to see to link to google](google.com) - text is surrounded by brackets, followed by the link in parentheses
